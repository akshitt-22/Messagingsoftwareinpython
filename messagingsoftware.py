Hello sagar bhai this is the code for messaging back and forth real time..
i have used many comments in this code so as it can be easy to understand.. 
i have corrected many mistakes in this code with the help of chatgpt and youtube.. 
i have also uploaded the raw/older code having some mistakes.. 
sorry i was unable to include end to end encryption(e2ee) in this code..
because i was facing a problem in vs code..
i had installed cryptography and also made a fernet key for e2ee..
still i was trying to resolve that problem for the last 2 hours but it is not resolved
